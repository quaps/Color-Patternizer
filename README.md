The initial motive was to provide a dynamic simulation for modernist monochromatic painting motifs. For instance, the user can examine countless color variations of Rodchenko's  painting Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow, & Blue. What this application provides is a means to extend the modernist vernacular of painting so that colorfields exist in time, developing perceptually with the user.

Specifically, the user sends pattern messages from TidalCycles, which are received in Max & mapped to colors. Max Receives OSC messages in the range of 1-5, which are mapped to various color schemes inspired by monochrome painters.

Schemes:
IMI: Color schemes inspired by Imi Knoebel

RYB: Inspired by the primary color scheme of Rodchenko's Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow, & Blue?

KlEE: A pattern weaver of symbols inspired by Paul Klee's landscapes
